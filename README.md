Challenge: How might we fill out PHQ-9 based on patientâ€™s posts on Reddit? Then, how might we ask the best follow-up question?

Solution: We created an AI system that, given a narrative social media dataset, identifies gaps in the information needed to answer the PHQ-9. It generates dynamic follow-up questions to ensure the dataset is comprehensive and accurately reflects the individual's experience, overcoming the limitations of static questionnaires.
